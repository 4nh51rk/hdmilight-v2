How to use:

1) Manufacture the HDMI receiver board that can be found in 
   the 'board' directory (CADSoft Eagle format).
2) Open the 'fpga/hdmilight.xise' project in Xilinx ISE and
   generate a bit file.
3) Edit 'firmware/config_lights.h' to set light definitions.
4) Run make in the 'firmware' directory to produce 'image.elf'
5) Merge the firmware into the bit file (from firmware directory):
   /opt/Xilinx/14.4/ISE_DS/ISE/bin/lin64/data2mem -bm ../fpga/progmem_bd.bmm -bt ../fpga/HdmilightTop.bit -bd image.elf -o b ../hdmilight.bit
6) Upload hdmilight.bit to the Papilio
7) Install the HDMI receiver board on to a Papilio One 250K FPGA board.
8) Connect LED strips to output pins
9) Open a serial terminal to the Papilio
10) Give the command to initialise I2C: 
   I I
11) Give the command to configure the light definitions and 
   the ADV611 chip: 
   I C
12) Connect HDMI source to receiver board
13) It should now be working.
